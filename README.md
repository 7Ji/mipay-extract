[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/linusyang92/mipay-extract.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/linusyang92/mipay-extract)

## Usage
Put MIUI 9 China Rom (OTA zip package) in the directory and double-click `extract.bat` (Windows) or run `./extract.sh` (macOS and Linux) to generate the flashable zip.

Support Windows, Linux and macOS (10.10 or above). Windows version has all dependencies included. For macOS, you need Java 8 runtime. For Linux, you may need both Java 8 and Python 2.7. For example, you can install all dependencies using `apt-get`:

```bash
apt-get install -y openjdk-8-jre python2.7
```

Automatic builds for selected devices are available in [releases](https://github.com/linusyang92/mipay-extract/releases).

## Xiaomi.eu Rom Patches

For xiaomi.eu rom users in China, you can also download the xiaomi.eu rom and run `cleaner-fix.sh` for creating a flashable zip with prefix `eufix-`. It contains patches for

1. Show Lunar dates in Calendar app.
2. Fix FC of cleaner app.
3. Show payment monitor options in setting page of Security app.
4. Use Chinese weather sources in Weather app.
5. Force file-based encryption of `/data` partition for Oreo-based roms.

**Use at your own risk!** Backup your data before flashing `eufix` package. Xiaomi.eu roms remove encryption by default. Re-enabling encryption may cause lost of your data.
